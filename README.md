# Simple-Linear-Regression-Salary-Prediction-Python  

This repository contains a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn library.

**Dataset**  

The dataset used for this project is Salary_Data.csv. It contains two columns:

**Years of Experience:** The number of years of experience of an employee.
**Salary:** The corresponding salary of the employee.
The dataset is loaded using pandas library.

**Dependencies:**  

Python  

pandas  

scikit-learn  

matplotlib

**This script will:**

Load the dataset.  

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  

Train a simple linear regression model on the training data.  

Predict salaries for the testing data.  

Visualize the results with scatter plots.
